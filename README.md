## Bike-Citi
Citi Bike is a bike sharing program in New York City that allows users to rent bikes from docking stations located throughout the city. The program was launched in 2013 and has since become a popular transportation option for both residents and tourists.
## Objective:
Investigate the relationship between customer characteristics and trip duration in Citi Bike bike sharing program in NYC but also take a deep insight in the data specialy aspects, that could influence trip duration, using data from Sep-Oct 2013
## Hypothesis:
Changes in customer characteristics will correspond to changes in mean trip duration
## Limitations
Study limited to certain areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn, may not be fully representative of entire NYC population
## Personal conclusion
* Customer characteristics, such as gender and age, may have a slight impact on trip duration, according to the data analysis.
* However, due to data limitations, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between customer characteristics and trip duration.
* The data set lacks key customer attributes, such as address or occupation, which could provide a deeper understanding of how customer characteristics affect trip duration.
* The study is limited to a specific geographic area and a short timeframe, which may not be representative of the larger population.
* On the other hand, the analysis shows that geographic and temporal factors, such as the location of the station and the hour of the day, have a significant influence on trip duration.
* To gain a deeper insight into the relationship between customer characteristics and trip duration, additional information about customers, such as their occupation or travel purpose, would be necessary
